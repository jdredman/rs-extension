# Conversation Context Memory Implementation

## Problem

The Chrome extension was not maintaining conversation context when making API calls to OpenAI. Each user message was being treated as an independent query, which meant:

- The AI couldn't refer to previous parts of the conversation
- Users had to repeat context in follow-up questions
- The conversation felt disconnected and less natural
- Multi-turn conversations were not possible

## Solution

I implemented conversation context memory by modifying the `handleChat` function in `popup.js` to include conversation history in every API call to OpenAI.

### Key Changes

1. **Enhanced Message Building Logic**:
   ```javascript
   // Build messages array starting with system message
   const messages = [
       {
           role: 'system',
           content: systemMessage
       }
   ];
   
   // Add conversation history (excluding current message)
   const historyMessages = currentConversation.messages.slice(0, -1);
   const recentHistory = historyMessages.slice(-CONFIG.MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES);
   ```

2. **Added History Limit Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES: 10, // Limit conversation history to prevent context overflow
   ```

3. **HTML Cleaning for Context**:
   - Assistant messages are cleaned of HTML content when sent as context
   - This prevents confusion while preserving conversational content
   - HTML previews are replaced with `[Resource links provided]` placeholder

4. **Proper Message Ordering**:
   - System message first
   - Page context (if relevant)
   - Conversation history (user/assistant pairs)
   - Current user message last

### Features

- **Context Preservation**: The AI remembers previous exchanges within the conversation
- **Smart Limits**: Only the most recent 10 messages are included to prevent token overflow
- **HTML Handling**: Rich content is cleaned when used as context but preserved in the UI
- **Performance**: Efficient slicing of message arrays to include only relevant history

### Example Conversation Flow

**User**: "Hi, I need help with my debt"
**Assistant**: "I recommend starting with Baby Step 1: Save $1,000 for your starter emergency fund."

**User**: "What's the next step after that?"
**Assistant**: *(Now has context that user is asking about what comes after Baby Step 1)*

### Technical Implementation

The conversation context is built in this order for each API call:

1. **System Message**: Core Ramsey Solutions instructions
2. **Page Context**: If user is asking about current page content
3. **Recent History**: Last 10 conversation messages (cleaned of HTML)
4. **Current Message**: The user's latest input

### Benefits

- **Natural Conversations**: Users can ask follow-up questions without repeating context
- **Better Understanding**: AI has full conversation context to provide relevant responses
- **Seamless Experience**: Conversations flow naturally like talking to a real advisor
- **Resource Continuity**: AI can reference previously mentioned resources or concepts

### Testing

Created comprehensive tests to validate:
- ✅ Conversation history is properly included
- ✅ Message ordering is correct
- ✅ HTML content is properly cleaned
- ✅ Context limits are respected
- ✅ Current message is properly added

The implementation ensures that the Ramsey Solutions Chrome extension now provides a natural, contextual conversation experience where the AI remembers and builds upon previous exchanges.
