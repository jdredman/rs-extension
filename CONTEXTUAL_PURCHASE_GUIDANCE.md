# Enhanced Contextual Purchase Guidance Implementation

## Overview
The Ramsey Solutions Chrome Extension AI has been enhanced to handle ambiguous questions like "should I buy this" by leveraging page context to provide specific, Ramsey-aligned financial guidance.

## Key Enhancements Completed

### 1. Enhanced Content Script Context Extraction
**File: `content.js`**

#### New Context Detection Features:
- **Purchase Context Extraction**: Detects prices, product information, financing terms
- **Page Type Classification**: Categorizes pages as shopping_cart, product_page, real_estate, etc.
- **Financial Terms Detection**: Identifies financing, APR, monthly payments, subscriptions
- **Subscription Indicators**: Detects recurring payment patterns

#### Enhanced CONFIG Object:
```javascript
SELECTORS: {
    purchase: ['.price', '.cost', '[data-price]', '.product-title'],
    financial: ['.payment', '.financing', '.loan', '.apr']
},
CONTEXT_PATTERNS: {
    shopping: ['buy', 'purchase', 'cart', 'checkout'],
    financial: ['loan', 'mortgage', 'finance', 'payment'],
    real_estate: ['house', 'home', 'property', 'mortgage'],
    automotive: ['car', 'vehicle', 'lease', 'financing'],
    subscription: ['monthly', 'recurring', 'auto-renew']
}
```

#### New Functions:
- `extractPurchaseContext()`: Extracts purchase-related data from page
- `determinePageType()`: Classifies page type based on content and URL patterns

### 2. Enhanced Page Relevance Detection
**File: `popup.js`**

#### Expanded Ambiguous Question Detection:
```javascript
const isPageRelevant = context && (
    // Direct page references
    userInput.includes('this page') ||
    userInput.includes('this article') ||
    
    // Ambiguous purchase questions
    userInput.includes('should i buy') ||
    userInput.includes('is this worth') ||
    userInput.includes('can i afford') ||
    userInput.includes('good deal') ||
    userInput.includes('what do you think') ||
    
    // Context-dependent financial questions
    (context.pageType !== 'general' && (
        userInput.includes('budget') ||
        userInput.includes('afford') ||
        userInput.includes('payment') ||
        userInput.includes('expensive')
    ))
);
```

### 3. Enhanced System Message for AI Guidance
**File: `popup.js`**

#### New Contextual Purchase Guidance Instructions:
```
CONTEXTUAL PURCHASE GUIDANCE: When page context is provided and users ask ambiguous questions like "should I buy this", "is this worth it", "can I afford this", I use the page context to provide specific Ramsey-aligned guidance:

Page Context Usage:
- Shopping/Product Pages: Guide through Ramsey purchasing principles
- High-Price Items: Discuss opportunity cost and emergency fund protection
- Financing/Subscription Services: Strongly discourage debt-based purchases
- Multiple Price Points: Help evaluate based on Baby Step priorities

When page context shows:
- Product prices → Discuss budgeting and cash payment principles
- Financing terms → Redirect to debt-free alternatives
- Subscription services → Address monthly payment trap
- Luxury/wants → Help distinguish needs vs wants
```

## Implementation Details

### Context Data Structure
The enhanced context now includes:
```javascript
{
    "url": "https://example.com/product",
    "title": "Product Page",
    "purchaseContext": {
        "prices": ["$2,999.00", "$124.96/month"],
        "productInfo": ["Apple MacBook Pro"],
        "financialTerms": ["financing", "monthly payment"],
        "hasFinancing": true,
        "hasSubscription": false
    },
    "pageType": "product_page",
    "content": { /* existing content structure */ }
}
```

### AI Response Enhancement
The AI now:
1. **References specific prices and products** from the page context
2. **Provides Ramsey-aligned guidance** based on the purchase type
3. **Warns against financing traps** when detected
4. **Calculates opportunity costs** for subscriptions and recurring payments
5. **Asks contextual questions** about Baby Step status and budget allocation

## Test Scenarios
